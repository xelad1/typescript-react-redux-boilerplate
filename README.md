# React Redux Typescript Webpack Calculator Example / Boilerplate

Run npm install

Run npm start

# Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Typescript 2
- Webpack 2

# Purpose

This application should serve as a boilerplate example of how these technologies work together.
The Redux application has some basic components and a reducer that handles all of the application logic.
This should be expandable for larger scale applications.

Typescript (as integrated) should compile regular Javascript but throw errors when type checking is not properly enforced.
